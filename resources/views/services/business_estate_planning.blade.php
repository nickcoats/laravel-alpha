        <h6>Estate Planning</h6>
        <p class="justify">In 2016, a married couple may have up to a combined $10.9 million dollars of assets (less the value of any gifts made during lifetime that reduced the individual’s lifetime exemption) before they will be subject to having to pay any U.S. federal estate tax upon death. On the other hand, a single person (other than a widow who has inherited their deceased spouse’s unused exemption) may pass away with up to $5.45 million dollars of assets before their estate would have to pay any U.S. federal estate tax. According to various authorities, given the inflation- adjusted federal estate and gift tax exemptions, less than 0.2% of estates will owe any federal estate tax.</p>
        <p class="justify">What does all of this mean? Essentially, the number of individuals and married couples who need to do sophisticated estate tax planning are the minority on the extreme side of the spectrum. Does this mean that there is no need for married couples or individuals to have estate planning documents? Not at all.</p>
        <p class="justify">Estate planning is much more than planning to mitigate a future tax event. In fact, estate planning is an intimate mosaic that involves many decisions that need to be made by clients after they have had the opportunity to consider the pros and cons of each available option.</p>
        <p class="justify">How do you want your assets to be administered and distributed if you are incapacitated? Who do you want to receive your assets when you pass away? Do you want these distributions to be outright to the beneficiary or held in trust for some period of time into the future? What are the potential asset protection issues should a beneficiary receive an asset outright rather than in trust? Are you in a second or third marriage with children from a previous marriage? Who will make health decisions on your behalf in the event that you are incapacitated and unable to do so on your own? These are some, but not all, of the many questions that should be considered by people who are contemplating an estate plan.</p>
        <p class="justify">Here is something important to note—there is no requirement that you have a certain amount of money before triggering the need to have an estate plan. If you are a living person, have any assets in your name, and wish that those assets go to particular people or charitable organizations when you pass away (or go to those individuals or organizations during your lifetime in the form of a gift), then you are a candidate for an estate plan.</p>
        <p class="justify">At ACMG, we take pride in guiding our clients through the estate planning process, which includes thoroughly educating clients about each document before they sign. Additionally, if you happen to already have estate planning documents, we can review those documents to ensure that they accurately reflect your current wishes. If you have any questions about the creation of a new estate plan or the review of an existing estate plan, please let us know and we will be happy to assist you.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tab-2" class="tab-pane">
        <h6>Probate</h6>
        <p class="justify">What is probate? Probate is a legal process where a court supervises the transfer of property from someone who has passed away to his or her devisees or heirs. In addition to the transfer of property to the beneficiaries of the estate, the probate process ensures that any debts or taxes owed by the decedent are paid.</p>
        <p class="justify">Depending on the complexity of the estate and the amount of court involvement needed for probate, expenses can vary greatly. At ACMG, we can help the personal representative of an estate navigate through this process during an understandably difficult time for a family that has lost a loved one.</p>
        <h6>Trust Administration</h6>
        <p class="justify">Many people choose to establish a revocable trust as part of their estate plan for two key reasons—to plan for the distribution of their assets during a period of incapacity and to minimize the involvement of the probate court after their passing. In a perfect world, if all of the assets that someone owns when they pass away are properly titled in the name of their trust, jointly titled with someone else (with right of survivorship), or set up to be paid through some sort of beneficiary designation, then the need to probate these assets may be eliminated.</p>
        <p class="justify">By circumventing the probate process, the trustee of the trust may administer and distribute the assets held in the trust more quickly and efficiently. Typically, the administration of a trust is not a court supervised process; however, trust administrations are similar to probating an estate in that the ultimate goal is also the transfer of property from an individual who has passed away to that individual’s beneficiaries who are identified in his or her trust.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tab-3" class="tab-pane">
        <h6>Business Succession Planning</h6>
        <p class="justify">If you’re like most business owners, you’ve worked hard to build a profitable company. While this is a fantastic accomplishment in and of itself, it is only one facet of the overall business cycle. Do you have partners in your business? Have you considered a plan of action if one of the partners passes away unexpectedly or becomes disabled? Would you be comfortable working with one of your partners’ heirs rather than having the right of first refusal to buy a deceased or disabled partner’s share of the business? How would you pay for that share of the business?</p>
        <p class="justify">At ACMG, we understand that the dynamic of each business and their owners is unique, and that one plan does not fit all. With our skilled and knowledgeable advisors, we can help you design a business succession plan that includes, among other things, a review of your existing operating agreement (or the creation of an operating agreement if you do not already have one), and the establishment of a buy-sell agreement with a cross-purchase plan.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tab-4" class="tab-pane">
        <h6>Asset Protection</h6>
        <p class="justify">Asset protection planning is for anyone seeking to protect their assets from potential creditors—it is not just for the super-wealthy.</p>
        <p class="justify">Anyone can get sued. Lawsuits can stem from car accidents, credit card debt, bank foreclosures, or unhappy customers, among many other things. If someone wins a monetary judgment against you, the financial ramifications could drastically affect you and your family. To help keep your assets away from creditors, you should consider moving them somewhere that creditors may have a more difficult time reaching them. Asset protection techniques include maximizing contributions to IRAs, moving funds to an irrevocable trust, retitling various assets, and using limited liability companies or family limited partnerships.</p>
        <p class="justify">It is important to note that asset protection planning should be done as a preventative measure, before you are sued. Under the law, you may not defraud current creditors. If a lawsuit has already been filed against you, or if you know you are going to be sued, and you transfer assets so that creditors can&#39;t reach them, a court may reverse the transfer. Because of this, it is a good idea to put a plan into place now before it’s too late.</p>
        <p class="justify">At ACMG, we can work with you to develop an asset protection plan that addresses your short and long-term financial goals.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tab-5" class="tab-pane">
        <h6>Fees</h6>
        <p class="justify">Most individuals and business owners cringe at the thought of paying high legal fees. While fees are inevitable when hiring an attorney, this expense does not have to be unreasonable. At ACMG, our goal is to streamline your estate and business planning needs to minimize the cost associated with documenting and accomplishing your goals.</p>
        <p class="justify">Are you interested in a fixed fee arrangement for your estate or business planning? At ACMG, we can help coordinate this for you.</p>
        <h6>Technology</h6>
        <p class="justify">We live in a time where technology has created many conveniences for all of us. Gone are the days where meetings have to take place in person between the hours of 9:00 to 5:00. Please don’t take this the wrong way—we prefer spending time with our clients in person; however, when family, work and travel commitments get in the way of finding the time to meet, we take pride in the fact that we offer alternative times and methods (e.g. video conferencing using Skype and FaceTime) to make sure the important discussions take place.</p>
